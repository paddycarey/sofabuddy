sofabuddy.py - An auto sorter for tv episodes

sofabuddy.py will search a folder for all tv episodes and automatically sort
them into the correct Show/Season/Episode hierarchy.  It will also retrieve the
episode title from tvrage.com and rename the file to make it more readable.

sofabuddy.py will also automatically handle replacing (nuking) of episodes to
ensure you always have the most up to date copy of the episode.

This script uses the python-tvrage api from pypi.

To install the api please run "easy_install python-tvrage" as root.

Usage: sofabuddy.py [options]
Example
        sofabuddy.py -d "/media/downloads" -h "192.168.1.1"
Options
        -?, --help                          Will bring up this message
        -d, --download_dir=DOWNLOAD_DIR     Override the default download directory
        -h, --host=HOST                     Choose the ip address of your XBMC box (default=127.0.0.1)

You should create /etc/sofabuddy/config.cfg using example_config.cfg as an
example.  You should define your directories in this file.

You can specify a directory to scan as an argument on the command line,
otherwise sofabuddy.py will scan the default download directory as defined in
the config file.
