sofabuddy.py - An auto sorter for tv episodes

sofabuddy.py will search a folder for all tv episodes and automatically sort
them into the correct Show/Season/Episode hierarchy.  It will also retrieve the
episode title from tvrage.com and rename the file to make it more readable.

sofabuddy.py will also automatically handle replacing (nuking) of episodes to
ensure you always have the most up to date copy of the episode.

This script uses the python-tvrage api from pypi.

To install the api please run "easy_install python-tvrage" as root.

specify all options on the command line.

sofabuddy.py will send a command to an XBMC box (remote or local) upon a
succesful move to initiate an update of the video library.
