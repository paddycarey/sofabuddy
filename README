tvwrangler.py - An auto sorter for tv episodes

tvwrangler.py will search a folder for all tv episodes and automatically sort
them into the correct Show/Season/Episode hierarchy.  It will also retrieve the
episode title from tvrage.com and rename the file to make it more readable.

tvwrangler.py will also automatically handle replacing (nuking) of episodes to
ensure you always have the most up to date copy of the episode.

This script uses the python-tvrage api from pypi.

To install the api please run "easy_install python-tvrage" as root.

Usage: ./tvwrangler.py

You can specify a directory to scan by using it as the first argument on the
command line, otherwise tvwrangler.py will scan the default download directory
as defined in the config file.
